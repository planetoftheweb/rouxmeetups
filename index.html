            <p>Drawing and painting flowers may seem like a first-year art student's assignment, but Lorenzo Garcia brings depth, shadows, light, and color to new heights with his unique technique of painting on canvas with ceramic glaze. This session is sure to be a hit with mixed media buffs.</p>

            <h3>The Art of Abstract<span class="small"> with <a href="#">Riley Rudolph Rewington</a></span></h3>
            <p><a href="#"><img class="speaker" src="images/speakers/Riley_Rewington_tn.jpg" alt="Photo of Rick Short"></a></p>
            <p>The leader of the MMA artistic movement in his hometown of Portland, Riley Rudolph Rewington draws a crowd wherever he goes. Mixing street performance, video, music, and traditional art, Riley has created some of the most unique and deeply poignant abstract works of his generation. Join Riley in Dennison Hall for an intimate discussion on The Art of Abstract, in which he shares his philosophies about modern abstract art, and critiques some of this own work with complete candor and a healthy dose of personality.</p>

    <article id="whoarewe">
      <h1>Who are we?</h1>
        <p>The Roux Academy gets thousands of submissions every year for artists interesting in participating in the CAC exhibits, and selects approximately 200 distinct pieces of contemporary art for display in their collective exhibit. In addition, 12 individuals are honored as Featured Artists - each being granted his or her own exhibit hall to display entire collections or themed pieces.</p>

        <p>Each Featured Artist has an opportunity to speak at one of our meetups and share his or her vision, perspective, and techniques with attendees on a more personal level than at our large conference. It is truly an honor to be a CAC Featured Artist and many past students artists who were featured at CAC have gone on to brilliant careers in art.</p>
